                <big>
                    JavaScript is a programming language that's often used to make websites more interactive and dynamic.It's lightweight and can be used on the client-side of a website to help users interact with the page. 
                    <br>
                    <br>JavaScript is also object-oriented, meaning it can create and manipulate objects, making it a flexible language.It was first called <mark>LiveScript</mark>, but later changed to JavaScript, possibly to capitalize on the popularity of Java.
                    <br>
                    <br>It was introduced in <code>1995</code> and is now supported by most web browsers.

He created the JavaScript programming language and co-founded the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.">Brendan Eich</abbr> for Netscape, originally called Mocha, then LiveScript.</mark> The name was changed to <strong>JavaScript</strong> as part of a marketing deal with Sun. It was introduced in Netscape Navigator 2.0B and later standardized as ECMAScript.

            <p>
                JavaScript and Java are two completely different languages; however, both are influenced by the <em>C language</em>. The difference between JavaScript and Java is that with JavaScript, common people that are not into programming find it easier to deal with.

                The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.
                <ul>
                <li>
                    JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.

        <h2>Client-Side JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
                Client-side JavaScript allows web pages to be more dynamic by including programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and create HTML content. This approach provides advantages over traditional server-side scripts and enables user-initiated event tracking.
            </p>

        <hr style="margin-top: 50px;">

        <h2>What Can JavaScript Do?</h2>
            <p>
                Some of the things that JavaScript can do are:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        JavaScript can react to event (mouse click, and pre-loading for webpage can lead to executing codes written in JavaScript)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        JavaScript can be used to validate data (forms that requires user input, instead of using server-side scripting, it can be used to validate and processing time)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        JavaScript can be used to create cookies (used to save or retrieved information from a visitorâ€™s computer)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        JavaScript can enhance a web page (can be used to add items such as pop-up window box, animation or dynamic images, menu from a drop down box)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
        <hr style="margin-top: 50px;">   

            <h2>Advantages of JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                    The merits of using JavaScript are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Less server interaction: You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Immediate feedback to the visitors: They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Increased interactivity: You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Richer interfaces: You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

        <hr style="margin-top: 50px;">

            <h2>Limitations of JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                    We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language. It lacks the following important features:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocessor capabilities.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some browsers do not support JavaScript
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any secret embedded in JavaScript could be extracted by a determined adversary
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            JavaScript and DOM (Document Object Model) provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the web
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Web site authors can not perfectly conceal how their JavaScript operates, because the code is sent to the client
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Source codes that has been deliberately made hard to understand can be reverse engineered so your codes are still exposed to possible threats.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages.
                </p>

            <h2>Where is JavaScript Today</h2>
                <p>
                    The ECMAScript Edition 5 standard will be the first update to be released in over four years. JavaScript 2.0 conforms to Edition 5 of the ECMAScript standard, and the difference between the two is extremely minor. The specification for JavaScript 2.0 can be found on the following site: <cite>http://www.ecmascript.org/</cite> Today, Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript conform to the ECMAScript standard, although both the languages still support the features that are not a part of the standard.
